The field of mortality can be analyzed (at minimal) with three complementary functions: hazard, survival and death probability density function.

Let denote X: the age at death of an individual and assume that this random variable is $X\geq 0$ and continuous. 

Suriving beyond age x is expressed as

$$
\begin{align}
S(x) & = Pr(X>x) \\
S(x) & = 1 - F(x) \\
S'(x) & = -f(x) 
\end{align}
$$

$$S(x) = Pr(X > x) = -\int^{\infty}_xf(t)dt$$

Let's now express the hazard function, also called the force of mortality:

$$
\begin{align}
h(x) &= lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{Pr(x \leq X < x + \Delta x | X > x)}{\Delta x} \\
 &= lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{Pr(X < x + \Delta x) - Pr(X \leq x)}{\Delta x} \cdot \frac{1}{Pr(X>x)} \\
 &= \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}
\end{align}
$$

Thus, the force of mortality can be expressed as

$$
\begin{align}
\boxed{h(x) = -\frac{d}{dx}ln(S(x))}
\end{align}
$$

and re-arranging that equation we expressed the survival probability at age t as

$$\boxed{S(t) = e^{-\int^t_0h(x)dx} = e^{-H(t)}}$$

or also

$$S(t+n) = S(t)e^{-\int^{t+n}_{t}h(x)dx}$$

where $H(t)$ is called the cumulative hazard.

Note that when $h(x)$ is constant, 

$$S(t) = e^{-ht}$$

From earlier derivation of $h(x)$ we can obtain a math expression for the death probability density function

$$\boxed{f(x) = h(x)S(x)}$$

Let's check these identities visually.
